# Roadmap

This is early development version. I am currently considering:
- [x] Parse 3 arguments `action` and `filename` and `extension`.
- [x] implement `cargo run -- screen homeScreen tsx` command.
- [x] break code into functions.
- [x] create any file.
- [x] verify if path exist before creation.
- [ ] create any file but check if file exist.
- [ ] verify if path exist before creation (look for other solutions and compare if there is a better one).
- [ ] implement template for `tsx` and `ts`.
